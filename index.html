                            Major league baseball has seen home run numbers rise over the past few seasons, 
                            showing that teams appear to be placing an emphasis on players that can hit the 
                            ball out of the ballpark. To truly test how high the home run numbers have gotten, 
                            I chose to test data from last season (2022) to the home run numbers from a season
                            during the height of the steroid era of baseball (2001). The steroid era was 
                            between 1994 and 2004, during which numerous players admitted to and tested 
                            positive for performance enhancing drugs (PEDS) such as steroids. Through this 
                            analysis, I hope to determine if there is a significant difference between the 
                            home run numbers in 2022 and the home run numbers in 2001. This 
                            analysis could show just how much emphasis teams are currently placing on home runs 
                            as they once did during the steroid era.
