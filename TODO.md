Items to add to various pages:

Create and host a data blog! Have an about the author section, and then a list of the projects that I have worked on. Sadly the lists here will not be filterable but hey its okay. 

create a welcome page and have different projects that I can load then embed on the html page so that they can play around with streamlit apps and models that I have built and deployed . 

Welcome Page:
- Headshot (located on the left of the screen)
    - Underneath the headshot should be:
        - Education Section (List of education experiences and schools attended)
        - Highlighted project
        - Links of social media accounts/contact information
- Description (background of my journey and work experience)
- Skills section (contains list of applicable skills such as python, machine learning, etc. with hyperlinks to the projects I have completed and added to the pages displaying each of those skills)
- maybe a "leave a note" section for recruiters to leave contact information and save their responses in some database?
- Resume (Button)
    - Resume pdf viewer so it can be viewed in browser
    - Download button that will download the document for the viewer

School pop-ups:
- Include various info like major gpa, relevant classes taken, etc.
- For each course add a small hover over describing each of the courses' details

Projects Page:
- List of projects completed with an overview description below each, when completed, etc
- filter by type of project (skills used)
- filter by user lookup (have a search bar and filter results accordingly)
- Each project should contain a brief blog post synopsis, then a link to the streamlit application so that the user can toy with things. 
- Create sub-categories (Data Science, Database Engineering, Data Analysis, etc.) and then open dropdowns for those projects and their descriptions on the projects page. 
- Could have some projects link/depend on other projects such as a data cleaning project that then links to another project through which the data was already cleaned.
